# How to contribute to an Inner Source project or repository
For smoothest onboarding process, please read through the instructions in this document before you try do your first commit or pull request.

## Prerequisites
1. You need to have a GitHub account to github.saab.se, which can be requested from [ServiceHub](https://servicehub.saabgroup.com/esc?id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=1ff61bf4a9fed11045ed9f84a564c0c3)
2. Once you have an account, reach out to our [Mattermost channel](https://mattermost.corp.saab.se/saab/channels/dev-gizmosdk) and ask for your AD user name to be added as a member to Inner Source organization.
3. If you haven't already, we recommend setting up a development environment.
4. Before starting to contribute, it is highly recommended to discuss the topic on which you wish contribute through for example Mattermost. It will give us, the maintainers, a head's up and we and others can also provide valuable info to aid you in your contribution.

## Contributing on an existing repository
Start by [forking the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) you wish to contribute to, and make your changes locally. Contributes to existing repositories are done through Pull Requests. So when you're done with your changes and have committed them to your fork, it's time to do a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) back to the original repository. One or more maintainers will have a look at your PR and either reject with comments or approve it before it can be merged to the original repository.
For faster approval, it's always wise to have an ongoing discussion about the wanted changes in Mattermost, and ping the maintainers once the PR is ready to be reviewed.

## Contributing with a new repository
If you want to start up a brand new functionality/add-on or a support library, creating a new repository (based on this template repository, see [README.md](README.md) for instructions) is the best way. You will then be the owner of the repository, and can decide on who can contribute, and how they should do it, but we recommend you stick to the same rules as laid out above.
